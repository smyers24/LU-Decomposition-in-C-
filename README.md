# LU-Decomposition-in-C-plusplus

# Abstract
Springs-mass systems are used in a great number of situations throughout the field of engineering. They have potential in scenarios such as observing simple harmonic motion or studying forces with gravity. In this case, we are evaluating the displacement of 3 masses that are hanging from springs at equilibrium. We will be utilizing Cramerâ€™s Rule, L-U decomposition, and the inversion of a matrix to do this.

This contains MATLAB and C++ code for the aforementioned methods.

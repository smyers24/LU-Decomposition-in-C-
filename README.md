# LU-Decomposition-in-C-plusplus

The code in this repo has code from a project made in school. The objective was to calculate the displacement of 3 masses in a spring-mass system using various computational methods. Additionally, this repo will feature the final paper that I wrote on the matter.

This contains MATLAB and C++ code for the various methods
